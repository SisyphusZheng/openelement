/**
 * check-seams.test.ts — negative proof for the seams-registry reader (P8).
 *
 * The check exists because `docs/architecture/seams.md` had no mechanical
 * reader (`grep -rn "seams" tools tests .githooks` found only runtime seam
 * files), so the AGENTS.md/P8 claim "a seam missing either does not pass the
 * gate" was not true: rows could lose cells, guards could be renamed, and the
 * KR-5 vaccine clause could be omitted without anything going red. A check
 * that only ever reports "0 violations on today's tree" proves nothing about
 * that, so this file pins the failure direction:
 *
 *   - the parser matrix: escaped pipes stay inside a cell, an unescaped pipe
 *     splits a row into six cells and is reported, empty cells are reported,
 *     a missing header/table is reported;
 *   - the guard matrix: a nonexistent `*.test.ts` path is a violation, a repo
 *     guard script (`check-*.ts`) is accepted, and a fixture-relative token
 *     (`e2e/probe.spec.ts` after the fixture directory) resolves;
 *   - the vaccine matrix: the literal missing/unreadable-behavior clause is
 *     required (the earlier liberal vocabulary match — "fails closed" anywhere
 *     in the row — no longer satisfies it), and a row carrying only that
 *     vocabulary is reported;
 *   - the evidence matrix: guard paths must be Git-tracked (a path that exists
 *     only in this working tree is reported), a guard spelling covered by
 *     `.gitignore` is reported even when the file does not exist in this tree
 *     (the lane-versus-integration gap), and an unreadable Git fails the check
 *     closed instead of assuming reproducibility;
 *   - the live tree: the registry as committed is clean, and every row carries
 *     the explicit clause.
