/**
 * island-scheduler.ts - Island strategy scheduling (single owner, #606).
 *
 * This module is the ONE owner of island load/visibility scheduling in the
 * browser (#606): `load`/`only` islands import immediately, `idle` islands
 * defer to browser idle time, `visible` islands import when any instance
 * enters the viewport, and `media` islands wait for a matching media query —
 * located by a deep, shadow-root-aware query because
 * islands live inside page-element DSD shadow roots where a light-DOM
 * querySelectorAll never looks (#562). Island modules carry no scheduling of
 * their own: a module only evaluates after this scheduler decided to import
 * it, and the import registers the island's custom element as its side
 * effect.
 *
 * PAGE SCOPE (B2): an activation decision is also a page-scope decision. A
 * tag activates only when the current page actually carries a host for it
 * (deep query, #562). This is the runtime form of the fact the build already
 * records per page in the island manifests (#1561): "an island that a page
 * never reaches is never fetched" (guide/islands-and-ssr). Without it, an
 * `idle`/`load`/`only` bucket imported every declared island chunk on every
 * page, which also dragged the shared element runtime into pages whose island
 * manifest is empty. A tag with no host keeps its factory (nothing is
 * consumed), so a later decision — a media-query change, the post-morph
 * rescan (`observeVisible`), or the bounded late-host probe below — can still
 * activate it. `open:ready` fires per strategy with the tags this page
 * actually activated, never for a bucket that started no load here.
 *
 * LATE HOSTS: the ready-time read is not the last word. A third-party
 * component may create an island's host later, inside its own open shadow
 * root, after an async chunk of its own has landed — and on a page with no
 * enhanced forms and no `visible` island, nothing would ever rescan for it,
 * so the island stayed dead. The probe re-runs the same rescan on a bounded
 * schedule while this page still has an unconsumed declared factory, and
 * dispatches one `open:island-host-timeout` event (informational, never a
 * drop: the factory stays in the map) when the budget is spent. It adds no
 * new activation path — `load()`'s host gate stays the only one — so a page
 * with no host still fetches nothing.
 *
 * Two strategy transitions arm the probe because they are the only events
 * those pages ever get (FR-02): an idle attempt that completes with idle
 * factories still unconsumed arms it from the deferred step, and a media
 * query whose change listener turns matching while the tag is unconsumed
 * arms it from that listener. The probe is armed once per page and adds no
 * activation authority, so both hooks only decide "keep looking"; the
 * 9000 ms absolute cap is checked at every probe entry and every
 * continuation-window entry before any DOM scan or activation (FR-03).
 *
 * The generated client entry imports this module through the
 * virtual:open-client-runtime specifier (resolved by build-client.ts) and the
 * bundler wires it in: there is no parallel string copy to drift, and the
 * logic carries normal unit tests (__tests__/island-scheduler.test.ts). The
 * module stays import-free and touches browser globals only through the
 * injected deps, so it bundles into any consumer build unchanged.
