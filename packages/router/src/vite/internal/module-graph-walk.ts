/**
 * Resolver-driven static module reachability (S-C1.4, #1609).
 *
 * The client build's graph contains the islands and only the islands, so a
 * Page, Layout or component that the server renders alone is not in it — and
 * neither is the authored `.css` edge it declares. The build host already knows
 * which ROUTE/PAGE/LAYOUT sources the server renders; what it could not do was
 * follow their module edges, because the app is free to reach a component
 * through any specifier form the bundler understands: a relative path, a
 * `package.json` `imports` subpath (`#site-ui/open-artifact-panel.tsx`), a
 * configured alias, or a package export path.
 *
 * This walk asks the BUNDLER for every answer. Specifiers come from the
 * compiler's own module analysis (`analyzeModuleSemantics.moduleSpecifiers`),
 * resolution comes from the live plugin context (`this.resolve`, with the
 * importing module as the importer so alias, `imports` and export conditions
 * apply exactly as they do for a real import), and both are deduplicated by
 * RESOLVED module identity — never by specifier text, which is not an identity.
 *
 * The walk does not execute anything, does not import anything, and does not
 * write anything: a caller may admit the returned modules for their admission
 * facts alone.
 *
 * Deliberate boundaries, reported rather than glossed over:
 *
 * - a `.css` specifier is not followed here: that edge is the compiler's to
 *   register (`registerStyleEdges`), and following it would be a second
 *   dependency model;
 * - `external` resolutions (the resolver's own verdict) are skipped;
 * - virtual ids (`\0…`, browser/worker builtins, `data:`/`http:` specifiers)
 *   have no file to read and are skipped;
 * - DYNAMIC imports are not static edges: they are not part of the static
 *   reachability contract, and a dynamic-only dependency is exactly the case
 *   the SSR half must diagnose instead of guessing;
 * - non-source files (JSON, assets) are skipped;
 * - the walk is bounded by `maxModules` so a pathological graph fails loudly
 *   instead of crawling without limit.
