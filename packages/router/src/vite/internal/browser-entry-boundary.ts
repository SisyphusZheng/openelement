/**
 * browser-entry-boundary.ts — the browser entry's Node boundary (fail closed).
 *
 * The client build's module graph IS the browser's graph: the generated client
 * entry, every admitted island, and everything they import transitively. A
 * `node:*` specifier anywhere in that graph is a defect the bundler does NOT
 * surface as a failure — Vite's browser resolver replaces it with an empty
 * `__vite-browser-external` stub, logs only "Module node:fs has been
 * externalized for browser compatibility", and the build stays green
 * (reproduced on the fixture island: `import 'node:fs';` exits 0). The page
 * then ships and the feature dies at runtime with no build signal at all.
 * Lint may hint; only the build boundary can fail closed.
 *
 * The guard is a `resolveId` hook mounted in the CLIENT build only
 * (`cli/build-client.ts`, `enforce: 'pre'` so it runs before Vite's own
 * resolver turns the specifier into that stub). `resolveId` is called for
 * every module edge the bundler follows — static and dynamic, direct and
 * transitive — so the whole client entry graph is covered by construction,
 * and the failure names both the specifier and the importing module.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT covered: the server half. A route module's `loader` (or any
 * module only the SSR graph reaches) may import `node:*` — that is the
 * zero-config server-side story — and this plugin is never mounted in the SSR
 * build, so it cannot see that graph. Bare builtin names (`fs`, `path`) are
 * not matched either: `node:` is the explicit, unambiguous spelling, and a
 * bare `fs` may legitimately be a package.
